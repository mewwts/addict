class Dict(dict):
    """
    Dict is a subclass of dict, which allows you to get AND SET(!!)
    items in the dict using the attribute syntax!

    When you previously had to write:

    my_dict = {'a': {'b': {'c': [1, 2, 3]}}}

    you can now do the same simply by:

    my_Dict = Dict()
    my_Dict.a.b.c = [1, 2, 3]

    Or for instance, if you'd like to add some additional stuff,
    where you'd with the normal dict would write

    my_dict['a']['b']['d'] = [4, 5, 6],

    you may now do the AWESOME

    my_Dict.a.b.d = [4, 5, 6]

    instead. But hey, you can always use the same syntax as a regular dict,
    however, this will not raise TypeErrors or AtrributeErrors at any time
    while you try to get an item. A lot like a defaultdict.
